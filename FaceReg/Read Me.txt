Image Saved Formate

There are 10 different images of 20 distinct subjects. For some of the
subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying lighting
slightly, facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/non-smiling)
and facial details (glasses/no-glasses).  All the images are taken
against a dark homogeneous background and the subjects are in
up-right, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).

The files are in PGM format and can be conveniently viewed using the 'xv'
program. The size of each image is 92x112, 8-bit grey levels. The images
are organised in 40 directories (one for each subject) named as:

		user name= users folder name

where name indicates the subject number (between 1 and 20). In each directory
there are 10 different images of the selected subject named as:

		Y.pgm

where Y indicates which image for the specific subject (between 1 and 10).
